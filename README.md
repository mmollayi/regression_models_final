# Regression Models final project

This repo contains my report for Coursera Regression Models course final project. The goal of the project was to assess the effect of transmission type (automatic vs. manual) on gas mileages of the cars in the mtcars dataset. We were supposed to perform a regression analysis to answer these two questions:

- Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
- Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.
