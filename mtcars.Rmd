In this project I want to analyze the mtcars dataset. I am  interested in exploring the relationship between `mpg` (miles per gallon) and other variables. Particularly I want to answer the following questions:

* Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?

* Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.
